commandline-ChoppedAndScrewed
=============================

Ultra simple shell script to play & screw/pitch down a track in the terminal on OS X.
It also throws a slowed-down "Ohhhhhhh Geee Linux Purped Down" plus the track name on top at the beginning to make it legit.

To use this:
1.  download or copy purple.sh
2.  `chmod +x purple.sh`
3.  Edit your .bash_profile and add an alias `alias purple='path/to/purple.sh`
4.  To run, just type in `purple` when you're cd'ed into a folder of audio files
5.  It'll ask you the track name. Type it exactly! Runs in background.


Ideas to extend
===============
*  Enable filename autocomplete
*  Cut off `say` when it hits a period (ie before .mp3 or .wav)
*  Add ascii art turntable effects
*  Add random text overlay at beginning similar to OG Ron C
